## Description
In this project, two players are playing a game with a dice. So when player 1 rolls the dice, His/her results are recorded and when player two rolls the dice again, His/Her results are also recorded too. So when they play a couple of times, each of their results are added. So when one player reaches 100, he/she is declared as the winner.
